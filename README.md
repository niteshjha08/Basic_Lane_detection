*Output of the image processing pipeline*
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to find lane lines in images and videos using basic image processing techniques such as Canny edge detection and Hough transforms, and help navigate a self-driving vehicle on both straight or curved roads. The detailed report of the pipeline used is available in the file *writeup.md*.
